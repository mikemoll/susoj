JOIN THE MOVEMENT
One rather ordinary mid-January morning a young man woke up from a dream…what he did not realise was that the moment he did wake up he would begin to live out that rather extraordinary dream. Driven by a passion to save the world from all its ills and injustices and an innate desire to help young people not unlike himself contribute positively to society Peter Moll founded the youth organisation Stand Up Shout Out on 18th January 2013.
It didn’t take long for the idea to find a voice in the hearts, minds and actions of a team of likeminded youth who worked tirelessly to pull off the organisation’s first event in June 2013: STAND UP SHOUT OUT FOR ELEPHANTS AND RHINOS, a walk that attracted over 1000 people to stand up and shout out against the poaching crisis currently facing us and the existence of some of the most majestic animals we share our planet with. The walk began at Uhuru Park and ended at the KWS main entrance complete with an accompanying marching band. The walk was symbolic too as all the participants joined the last stretch of activist Jim Nyamu’s 1500km walk around the country creating awareness about the merciless slaughter of elephants and rhinos and sensitizing communities on the importance of these creatures. This initiative was quickly followed by a Charity Netball Tournament in collaboration with another youth organisation, We Are One. The tournament was geared toward the same cause including a Q & A session with Jim Nyamu, creating awareness, especially among the youth, on the danger facing our heritage.
By the end of August 2013 SUSO had organised two more incredibly successful events: Stand Up Shout Out-FEED A SOUL and Stand Up Shout Out-VERBALIZE~REALIZE. The Feed A Soul held at Kibera Day Nursery School, Nairobi Kenya was the brain child of Kandeel Butt, a spirited and incredibly generous young woman who saw a real need to feed the less fortunate beyond their physical need for food but through giving time, love and most importantly a listening ear too. The event attracted over 40 hands-on and passionate volunteers between the ages of 13 and 25 all ready and willing to give their time, energy and resources towards this great cause. Apart from food, clothes, books and medical donations there were special performances by the Bomas Of Kenya dancers and the young talented Kibera Hamlets troupe who gave the professional acrobats a run for their money. As part of the sustainable vision, the SUSO family hope to continue their work here with the Lions Club of Kenya to build another nursery to allow the mothers of Kibera to earn a living while leaving their children in safe hands.
Stand Up Shout Out-VERBALIZE~REALIZE was created to bridge the gap between the short comings of a society where people complain and nothing is put into action and the ingenious and valuable perspectives and  solutions that the youth have to offer. The dream, fostered by the charming and visionary Claire Rotich, was to create a forum where the young people of Kenya could come and not only vent their frustrations with the status quo on so many issues that affect us as a generation, a country and society in general; but to also come together to create the solutions to these problems together (the Verbalize portion) and implement them (the Realize portion). The event held at the Sarit Centre Expo Centre in Nairobi Kenya attracted around 150 young, intelligent, driven, inspired and assertive people looking to make a positive lasting difference in this world despite what challenges or barriers would present themselves.
Since these first four events Stand Up Shout Out has grown in leaps and bounds with an overwhelming following and public support base of over 1000 people from all over the world, all different ages though the majority are under 30. The youth organisation continues to look forward and outward for opportunities to create positive outlets for the youth to contribute to making a wonderful and sustainable difference to those around them. With a committed, outstandingly talented and dynamic core team of around 20 members the organisation has many more ideas and projects to offer with the promise of welcoming and supporting anyone else’s ideas that are sustainable and in line with the positive mentality and legacy that we would like to set us apart. 
Anyone can join the movement today, and there are lots of ways to do that but we always say the best way is by coming to one of our events and seeing in person what we do and then talking to us about how you would like to help! Our next event is an open mic event for anyone wanting to showcase their music, poetry, dance, acting or any other artistic talent: STAND UP SHOUT OUT-THE OPEN STAGE taking place on Sunday September 8th 2013 at The Tree House Club on Waiyaki Way, Nairobi Kenya. Details on how to sign up to perform (by Thursday 5th September 2013) or attend can be found here:
